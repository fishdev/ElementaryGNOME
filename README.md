ElementaryGNOME
===============

ElementaryGNOME is an Elementary-style GTK+ and GNOME-Shell theme. It brings Elementary/Mac OS X style to the GNOME3 desktop while still supporting the Elementary core apps. It consists of the Elementary GTK3 theme, the Elementary GTK2 theme, the Numix Frost Light metacity theme, and the MosLight GNOME-Shell theme. Each theme has been modified slightly to fit in with the Elementary color scheme but still work properly with GNOME.

### Requirements

* Any GNOME-compatibile Linux distribution
* GNOME 3.12 or higher
* A theme-changing utility

### Installation

ElementaryGNOME can be installed in the same way as other system themes:

1. Download the ElementaryGNOME source files.
2. Create the archive into `/usr/share/themes/`. This requires root privileges.
3. Use a theme manager (such as GNOME Tweak Tool) to change the Window, GTK+, and Shell theme to "ElementaryGNOME".

Enjoy your stylish new desktop!
